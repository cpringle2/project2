	  <p><center>Lots of schools don't include Fine Arts in part of their daily curricular simply because of money.
	  Money is a big issue when<br>it comes to academic classes, especially when the government doesn't
	  require for the classes to be taken to graduate from<br>high school.

	  <p><center>High schools claim that having Fine Arts programs won't bring in as much money as sports. They
	  say that people come to and pay for sports more often then people would for a showcase or play. The only
      reason why more people may come to sporting events is because it sits more people at a time.</center></p>
